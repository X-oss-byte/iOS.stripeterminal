 Implement this protocol to handle a connected local mobile reader's events throughout
 the lifetime of its connection.

 Implementing this delegate is required when connecting to any Local Mobile reader.

 The provided delegate must be retained by your application until the reader disconnects.

/**
 The SDK is reporting that the reader has started installing a software update.

 There are two scenarios when a reader's software update can be installed. Some
 updates must be installed immediately, and may be being installed automatically
 during `connectReader:`.

 Required updates will only start installing during `connectReader:`. Once your app's
 `connectReader:` completion is called, `didStartInstallingUpdate:` will only fire
 from requests to install via `installUpdate:`.

 Note that required updates are critical for the reader to have the
 correct configuration and prevent receiving `SCPErrorUnsupportedReaderVersion`.

 @param reader The originating reader.
 @param update The `SCPReaderSoftwareUpdate` with an `estimatedUpdateTime` that
   can be used to communicate how long the update is expected to take.
 @param cancelable  This cancelable is provided to cancel the
   installation if needed. Canceling a required update will result in a failed
   connect with error `SCPErrorUnsupportedReaderVersion`. Some updates will
   have a nil cancelable because these updates can not be canceled.
